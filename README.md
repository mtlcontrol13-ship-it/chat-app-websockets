# Native WebSockets Chat App

Created a simple chat application using native WebSockets in Node.js without any external libraries. This project demonstrates how to set up a WebSocket server and client for real-time communication. THis is the task given to me during my internship to research WebSockets.

## Features

- Real-time messaging between multiple clients
- Simple and lightweight implementation using native WebSocket API
